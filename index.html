    <h1>Welcome to Hong Kong Egg Tarts</h1>

    <p>
        Hong Kong egg tarts are a popular and delicious pastry treat originating from Hong Kong. These delectable tarts consist of a flaky, buttery crust and a smooth, creamy egg custard filling.

        The crust of Hong Kong egg tarts is similar to that of Western-style tarts, but the filling sets them apart. The custard filling is made from a mixture of eggs, sugar, milk, and sometimes a touch of vanilla extract. The result is a rich and velvety custard that is both sweet and slightly savory.
